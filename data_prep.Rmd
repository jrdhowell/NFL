# The main objective is to merge all of our data. The 'Player' variable will be our identifier variable and will be used as the common variable to merge the data sets.

# The 'base' variable in dataframe df will be the target variable, so df will be the starting dataframe to which other data sets will be merged.

# There are a couple things that need to be addressed as the other data sets are merged. 

# (1) Make any duplicate entries in the 'Player' variable in df unique.
# (2) Check for any of the 'Player' values addressed in (1) in any of the data sets to be added, and address those if possible
# (3) Check for any duplicate values, or NULL data, in the 'Player' variable in the data sets to be added, and address
# (4) Add a suffix to the non-'Player' variables in the additional data sets incase there are any matching variables names among the datasets (for example, 'Avg' is seen as a variable name in multiple data sets)
# (5) After data is combined, export the data in a new .csv file
